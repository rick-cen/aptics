# Snap7

This is a fork of http://snap7.sourceforge.net/


This fork focuses on extending the Snap7Server module to support some features helping to implement a software PLC.
These features are currently:
* support for program blocks (up-/download, listing)
* some dynamic SZLs
* vartable watching
* monitor mode

For more details I refer to the commit history.
Please note that this fork is currently at version 1.4.0.

Cleanup, more fixes and documentation will follow.
